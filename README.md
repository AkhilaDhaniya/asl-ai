## About
All too often, we see that people who are hard of hearing are expected to adapt to the preferences of those with typical hearing. We believe that it's equally important to accommodate for the hard of hearing, and provide resources for able-bodied people to learn ASL. Our motivation is to bridge the gap between these two communities, and create a learning environment that is inclusive, supportive, and educational for all.

## Usage
- ASL Detection: Enter the letter you wish to sign, then take a picture of you signing the letter, preferably with your face out of the frame and a clear background. The model will give you feedback on how well you signed, and whether you need to adjust your form.
- Text to ASL: Enter a letter you want to learn to sign, then receive a picture of how to sign it.
- Resources: Further resources for learning ASL.
