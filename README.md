## About
All too often, we see that people who are hard of hearing are expected to adapt to the preferences of those with typical hearing. We believe that it's equally important to accommodate for the hard of hearing, and provide resources for able-bodied people to learn ASL. Our motivation is to bridge the gap between these two communities, and create a learning environment that is inclusive, supportive, and educational for all.
